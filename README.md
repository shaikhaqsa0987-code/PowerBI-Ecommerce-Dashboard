E-Commerce Sales Dashboard in Power BI 
Upskilling with Power BI: My E-commerce Sales Dashboard Project
As part of my self-learning journey, I created an interactive e-commerce sales dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
Key Learnings from this project:
Developed interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and complex drill-down parameters.
Built connections, joined tables, and wrote calculations to enable user-driven visualizations.
Explored various custom visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and more.
This project helped me strengthen my data modeling, visualization, and analytical skills while making insights accessible and actionable.
